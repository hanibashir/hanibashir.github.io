### About the App

***Diktat*** is a mobile application for practicing German vocabulary. Users can add words to the app and later test their knowledge. The application audibly reads out the saved list of words, prompting users to input both the corresponding  word, its plural form, and the word's gender (Artikel).

### Key Achievements:

- ***Language and Architecture:*** This project marked my initiation into Kotlin for Android development, broadening my programming language expertise.

- ***Design Pattern Mastery:*** I gained proficiency in implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, enhancing the app's structure and maintainability.

- ***Database Integration:*** Utilizing the Room database, I successfully implemented a storage solution, allowing users to persistently save application data on their mobile devices.

- ***Libraries and Plugins:*** The project provided hands-on experience with essential Android libraries and plugins, including the Navigation component, Safe Args, and Data Binding.
