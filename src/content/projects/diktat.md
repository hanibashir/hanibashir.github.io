### About the App

***Diktat*** is a mobile application designed for practicing German vocabulary. Users can input words and subsequently test their knowledge with the app. The application audibly reads out the entered word, requiring users to correctly input the corresponding translation.

### Key Achievements:

- ***Language and Architecture:*** This project marked my initiation into Kotlin for Android development, broadening my programming language expertise.

- ***Design Pattern Mastery:*** I gained proficiency in implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, enhancing the app's structure and maintainability.

- ***Database Integration:*** Utilizing the Room database, I successfully implemented a storage solution, allowing users to persistently save application data on their mobile devices.

- ***Libraries and Plugins:*** The project provided hands-on experience with essential Android libraries and plugins, including the Navigation component, Safe Args, and Data Binding.

### Technologies Used:
